# Scuttlebutt private-message E2EE — isolated checkpoint

Date: 28 September 2026. Branch: `codex/scuttlebutt-e2ee-foundation`.

## What exists today

This is a transport-format prototype and implementation plan, **not functioning
E2EE**. Nothing is wired into live chat. No dependency, native plugin, database,
UI badge, production deployment or message deletion is included.

`services/chat/e2ee/directMessageEnvelope.ts` proposes bounded, versioned,
per-device framing for opaque provider bytes. It rejects legacy text, unknown
protocols and extra fields (including plaintext previews and keys). Its tests
prove framing behaviour only. Anyone can base64-encode plaintext and put it in
the ciphertext field: passing validation proves neither encryption nor sender
authenticity. Do not use this validator to display a security badge.

Checkpoint validation: 33 focused framing tests passed; isolated strict TypeScript
checking of the module and tests passed. A read-only review caught and corrected
the maximum-size round-trip boundary. No full app build, real-device exchange or
cryptographic security audit was performed for this checkpoint.

## Direction and unresolved provider gate

Target private DMs first, encrypted by default once released. Public Scuttlebutt
channels remain public; private groups need a separate group-protocol decision.

Signal's [Triple Ratchet specification](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/)
combines its classical Double Ratchet with a Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet. PQXDH
can establish the initial session. AES-256 alone is not that protocol; we will
not implement the ratchets or select replacement primitives ourselves.

Candidate: [libsignal](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal), whose Rust core
has Swift, Java and TypeScript wrappers. Its repository lists AGPL-3.0 and says
external use is unsupported. Its npm distribution uses native Node libraries,
not a drop-in browser/WebView implementation. **Do not add it yet.** First:

1. Resolve licensing/distribution suitability before adoption; this document is
   not a legal conclusion or permission to change Thalassa's licensing.
2. Pin and inspect a release; prove its Swift API actually exposes the required
   Triple Ratchet negotiation and message processing on our supported iPhones.
   A protocol document or npm package name does not prove adapter capability.
3. Decide browser support through a maintained, reviewed implementation. Never
   move private-key operations to a server to make the website work. Unsupported
   clients must not fall back to plaintext or silently downgrade the protocol.

## Current plaintext paths to replace together

| Boundary                       | Existing source                                                                         | Required change                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DM send/history/inbox/realtime | `services/ChatService.ts`: `sendDMForScope`, `getDMThread` and subscription/inbox paths | New ciphertext transport and local decryption; no server-generated plaintext preview.                                                   |
| Offline queue                  | `ChatService.ts`: `queueOffline`, `syncOfflineQueue`                                    | Replace readable Preferences JSON for private DMs with protected drafts and a durable ciphertext outbox.                                |
| Optimistic reconciliation      | `hooks/chat/useChatDMs.ts`                                                              | Stable client message IDs, not text matching.                                                                                           |
| Guardian hails                 | `services/GuardianService.ts`: `sendHail`                                               | Direct DM-table insertion currently bypasses ChatService; route through the same protected boundary.                                    |
| Pin drops and recipe shares    | `ChatService.ts`: `sendPinDrop`, `sendRecipeShareDM`                                    | Encrypt the whole structured payload.                                                                                                   |
| Push                           | `supabase/migrations/20260723090000_security_hardening_core.sql`: `queue_dm_push`       | Currently copies message text into notification bodies. New pushes must be generic and contain no content/location preview.             |
| Storage                        | `services/auth/secureStorage.ts`, `services/nativeStorage.ts` and native plugins        | Existing allowlists do not provide a chat ratchet store. Build a dedicated audited storage boundary, not a blanket allowlist expansion. |

Existing 4,000-character text limits are not suitable ciphertext limits. Keep the
new format separate from the legacy `DirectMessage.message` field. The proposed
256 KiB ciphertext cap is an abuse bound pending provider measurement, not a promise
about supported payload sizes. It does not authorize attachments or uploads.

## Session, delivery and privacy invariants

- Supabase relays ciphertext and public device/prekey material only; secret keys
  and ratchet state remain on endpoints. Servers still learn routing metadata,
  timing and approximate sizes. E2EE is not anonymity or protection from a
  compromised phone, injected client code, or a recipient copying a message.
- Authenticate device identity, enforce account ownership/blocking on the
  server, and bind conversation/device/message context to provider-authenticated
  data. Outer IDs and protocol labels are untrusted until authenticated.
- Default encrypted sessions may use clearly labelled first-use trust; an
  optional fingerprint/QR verification adds a distinct verified state. Changed
  identities block sending until explicitly resolved. Never silently replace a
  trusted identity from a server response. Plan key-directory consistency and
  device-list authentication; TLS alone does not prevent server substitution.
- Serialize session operations. Atomically persist ratchet advancement **and**
  the exact ciphertext outbox item before upload; retry the same envelope.
  Enforce idempotency scoped to sender device, client message and recipient
  device. A timeout after server acceptance must not create a duplicate message.
- Receiving must atomically commit session state and local message/dedup state.
  Bound skipped-key storage and replay/out-of-order handling using provider
  mechanisms. Define crash, backup rollback, logout, reinstall and revocation
  behaviour before shipping. Protect local message history separately: forward
  secrecy does not hide plaintext history kept on an unlocked device.
- Start with an explicitly enforced single-device pilot; fail closed for an
  unsupported second device. Multi-device fanout and own-device copies come
  later, with authenticated device membership and revocation. Study Signal's
  [Sesame specification](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/sesame/).
- Encrypt future attachments client-side with independent keys, carrying keys
  and integrity metadata inside encrypted messages. No public plaintext URLs,
  telemetry, debug logs, moderation payloads or notification previews.
- Keep public-channel moderation separate. Private-message reports must be an
  explicit user disclosure of selected content, not automatic server scanning.

## Safe cutover and acceptance gates

1. **Provider spike:** license decision, pinned dependency, two real iPhones
   exchange messages with confirmed negotiated suite; native store design and
   locked-device/logout behaviour documented. No live chat switch yet.
2. **Transport:** reviewed device/prekey/envelope schema, strict RLS, atomic
   prekey claims, idempotency, rate/size/expiry bounds; generic push. Validate
   the experimental framing against provider bytes before freezing version 1.
3. **Client integration:** one authenticated send/decrypt boundary covers all
   paths above; replace plaintext private queues and previews. Preserve current
   account-generation and bilateral-block race protections.
4. **Adversarial verification:** tampering, replay, missing/out-of-order messages,
   concurrent sends, prekey exhaustion, key change, downgrade, offline retry,
   crash at each persistence boundary, account switch and restore tests. Inspect
   captured requests, stored rows, notifications and logs for plaintext leaks.
   Mock tests alone do not validate cryptographic integration.
5. **Release:** independent security review and device tests before security
   claims. Badge distinguishes encrypted from fingerprint-verified and from
   unavailable. Legacy clients cannot write plaintext after cutover. Existing
   server-readable history is never retrospectively labelled E2EE. Although the
   owner previously allowed test-message deletion, do not delete anything in
   this checkpoint; confirm exact cleanup scope at migration time.

Next session: resolve the provider/license/platform gate and build the smallest
native two-device spike. Do not merge or deploy this branch as completed E2EE.
